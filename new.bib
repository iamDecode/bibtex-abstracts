    title = "Through the Lens of Split Vote: Exploring Disagreement, Difficulty and Calibration in Legal Case Outcome Classification",
    abstract = "In legal decisions, split votes (SV) occur when judges cannot reach a unanimous decision, posing difficulty for lawyers who must navigate diverse arguments and opinions. high-stakes domains, understanding the alignment of perceived between humans AI systems is crucial to build trust. However, existing NLP calibration methods focus on classifier's awareness predictive performance, measured against human majority class, overlooking inherent label variation (HLV). This paper explores as naturally observable disagreement value pluralism. We collect judges' vote distributions from European Court Human Rights (ECHR), present SV-ECHR, case outcome classification (COC) dataset with SV information. taxonomy SV-specific subcategories. further assess models humans, well confidence- human-calibration COC models. observe limited judge distribution. To our knowledge, this first systematic exploration judgements in NLP. Our study underscores necessity research measuring enhancing model considering HLV decision tasks."

    title = "{IMBUE}: Improving Interpersonal Effectiveness through Simulation and Just-in-time Feedback with Human-Language Model Interaction",
    abstract = "Navigating certain communication situations can be challenging due to individuals' lack of skills and the interference strong emotions. However, effective learning opportunities are rarely accessible. In this work, we conduct a human-centered study that uses language models simulate bespoke training provide just-in-time feedback support practice interpersonal effectiveness skills. We apply framework from Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), DEAR MAN, which focuses on both conversational emotional present IMBUE, an interactive system provides 25\% more similar experts' feedback, compared generated by GPT-4. IMBUE is first focus emotion management simultaneously, incorporate domain knowledge in providing grounded psychology theory. Through randomized trial 86 participants, find IMBUE's simulation-only variant significantly improves participants' self-efficacy (up 17\%) reduces negative emotions 25\%). With additional participants demonstrate 17\% improvement skill mastery, along with greater enhancements (27\% more) reduction (16\% simulation-only. The mastery only measure transferred new difficult situations; situation specific necessary for improving reduction."
